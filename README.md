This is the vimrc config that I use. It is scraped from many different sources and some of my own changes.


To start using it do following:


1. Have VIM installed on your machine.


2. Install Vundle by doing: 
	
   git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim


3. Finally download the '.vimrc' file to your root directory:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korytiak/Sveto-vimrc/master/.vimrc


4. Open it in vim with:

   vim .vimrc


5. Modify it to your liking and dont forget to run:

   `:w`                                             -save the config file
   `:so%`                                           -to reload the config file
   `:PluginInstall`                                 -to install plugins
   `:PluginUpdate`                                  -to update them


For more info about the ones that I have put in my .vimrc go to each plugins github page and read all about what it does. 
I also wrote some useful comments in the .vimrc file itself about some of its configuration lines.
